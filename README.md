## About

This project is primarily used for me to practice learning [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) but will double as a central site for family management type things. Currently planned "tools" that will be used here are:

### Mini Bank

This tool will be used by my son to track his money. It will act as the name entails -- a miniature bank for him to learn money management and ease how getting paid for chores and such works

### Task Manager

This will mostly help me track tasks. I'll be able to choose how I'm notified: Email, Text, Push Notification (maybe). The intent is for this to be integrated with AWS for certain features such as these notifications
