  <h2 class='sectioned'>About this Project</h2>

  <p>
    This project is primarily used for me to practice learning
    <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> but will double as a central site for family
    management type things. Currently planned "tools" that will be used here are:
  </p>

  <h3>Mini Bank</h3>
  <p>
    This tool will be used by my son to track his money. It will act as the name entails --
    a miniature bank for him to learn money management and ease how getting paid for chores
    and such works
  </p>

  <h3>Task Manager</h3>
  <p>
    This will mostly help me track tasks. I'll be able to choose how I'm notified:
    Email, Text, Push Notification (maybe). The intent is for this to be integrated
    with AWS for certain features such as these notifications
